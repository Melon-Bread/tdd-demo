20171211-fizzbuzz branch
========================

This 20171211-fizzbuzz branch has the files created from the Introduction to
[Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
presentation at the
[2017-12-11](https://www.meetup.com/Central-Ohio-Python-Users-Group/events/245705538/)
[COhPy](http://cohpy.org/) meeting.
Test Driven Development is a process. It is often abbreviated TDD.

We started with the master branch, to do the setup,
then for the meeting's code, created this branch off of an earlier commit.
We used fizzbuzz as the sample task to accomplish.
We did it in much finer grained steps than in the master branch.
